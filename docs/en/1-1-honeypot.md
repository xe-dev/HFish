### Definition of honeypot 

**Honeypot** technology is essentially **a kind of technology that **deceives the attackers by arranging some hosts**, **network services** or **information** as bait to induce attackers to attack them. Therefore, the attack behavior can be **captured** and **analyzed**, the tools and methods used by the attackers can be understood, while the intention and motivation of the attack can be inferred. It can make the defenders clearly understand the security threats they face, and enhance the security protection capabilities of the actual system through technical and management means. 

### Advantages of honeypots 

\>**Fewer false alarms and accurate alarms** 

Honeypots are obfuscated in the network as a "**shadow**" of normal business, and should not be touched under normal circumstances, and each touch can be regarded as a threatening behavior. For example, in other detection-based products, it is common to misjudge a normal request as an attack, while for honeypots, there is almost **no normal request**, and even if there is, it is a detection behavior. 

\>**In-depth detection and rich information** 

Different from other detection-based security products, honeypots can **simulate business services and even the response to attacks**, fully obtain all the content of the entire interaction, and obtain the N steps after the attacker's detection behavior at the maximum depth, with more detection points and information. 

For example, for an **SSL encryption** or **industrial control environment**, honeypots can easily be disguised as businesses to obtain complete attack data. 

\>**Active defense, foreseeing the future, producing intelligence** 

In every enterprise, such a scenario occurs almost every minute: an attacker lurking in the corner of the Internet launches an Attack Detection, there is no security loophole in the defender's business, and the matter is gone after the IRS alarms. 

After applying honeypot products, it is converted to an **active defense idea**: 

the honeypot responds to the attack detection, tricks the attacker into thinking that there is vulnerability, and then sends more instructions, including downloading the Trojan program from the remote address. All this is not only completely recorded; it can also be converted into threat intelligence to provide traditional detection devices for accurate detection of host failure at some point in the future. 

It can be found that after switching to the proactive protection ideas, **threat detection has increased from targeting single, changeable attacks to application threat intelligence and even TTPs detection**. 

\>**Less dependent on the environment, expand horizons** 

Because it is an Integrated Security Products, honeypots** do not need to **change the existing network structure, and many honeypots are in the form of software, which are very friendly to various virtual and cloud environments and have low deployment costs. Honeypots can be widely deployed in the **cloud** and **in the downstream stub networks of access switches**. As **lightweight probes**, they can aggregate alarms to situational awareness or traditional detection devices for analysis and display. 

### Honeypots and Intelligence 

It is obvious that **honeypot** is a very accurate, stable, and appropriate **intelligence-aware probe**. The greatest value of honeypots is** to induce attackers to demonstrate their capabilities and assets**. Coupled with a series of advantages such as fewer false positives and abundant information, combined with situational awareness or local intelligence platform, private threat intelligence can be stably produced.
