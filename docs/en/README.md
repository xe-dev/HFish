#### HFish design concept

HFish is a community free honeypot that focuses on enterprise security scenarios. It provides users with independently operable and practical functions from three scenarios: intranet loss detection, internet threat awareness, and threat intelligence production. It increases users' capabilities in the field of loss awareness and threat intelligence through a secure, agile, and reliable middle and low level interactive honeypot.

HFish has more than 40 honeypot environments, free cloud honeynet, highly customizable honeybait capability, one click deployment, cross platform multi architecture, domestic operating system and CPU support, extremely low performance requirements, email/syslog/webhook/enterprise WeChat/nail/fly book alarm and other features to help users reduce operation and maintenance costs and improve operational efficiency.

#### Why HFish

##### Free, simple and safe honeypot products

Honeypot is usually defined as a detection product with lightweight detection capability and low false alarm rate. At the same time, it is also one of the high-quality sources for enterprises to produce local threat intelligence. HFish can help users of small and medium-sized enterprises avoid warning floods in their daily security operations, and increase their threat perception and intelligence production capabilities at a low cost. At present, the strength of the community is constantly helping HFish improve itself and jointly explore the best practice of deception defense.

##### how it works

HFish is widely used to sense the horizontal movement of lost hosts in office intranet, production environment, cloud intranet and other environments, employee account leakage, scanning and detection behavior, private intelligence production and even internal drills and security awareness training. Various alarm output forms of HFish are combined with state, NDR, XDR or log platforms to greatly expand the detection vision.

#### HFish architecture

HFish adopts B/S architecture, and the system consists of a management end and a node end. The management end is used to generate and manage the node end, and receive, analyze and display the data returned from the node end. The node end receives the control of the management end and is responsible for building the honeypot service.

In the case of minimizing testing, you can directly test the honeypot service by installing the management side and through the built-in nodes in the management side.
